# PsvDecryptCore
Video file decryptor for a famous online developer training site. Originally developed by [KevinWang15](https://github.com/KevinWang15/).

# Windows / Ubuntu Binaries
You can find the latest release on the project's AppVeyor.

# What's different?
The original application was poorly designed with little to no multi-thread operation in mind. This version is re-written from scratch and improves the performance by up to 200%.
